# Directory Navigator
This project involved making a website that allows users to access online the contents of a predefined folder on my machine.

This practical required me to get familiar with Nodejs and the Websocket API (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws), and have a basic level of competancy with  Javascript, HTML and CSS.
